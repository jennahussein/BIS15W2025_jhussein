# About Me 
My name is Jenna Hussein, I'm a fourth year undergraduate student majoring in Genetics and Genomics at UC Davis. My one thing I want to gain from undergrad is getting a well rounded education, meeting new people, and making connections. I LOVE getting philosophical and asking open-ended, thought-provoking questions. The best way to reach me is by email which is jenhussein@ucdavis.edu.

Some random facts about me:

- My favorite fruit is mango 🥭

- My favorite animal is a bear 🐻

- My favorite artist/singer is Sza 🌊

- I am currently binge watching Criminal Minds

- I am a certified medical assistant but I don't use my certification anymore after I decided I wanted to become a professor 💉🩺🩸


# 📊 Why BIS15L?
As a genetics major I've grown to realize that the amount of data in this field is quite large. I am curious and the type of person that wants to know everything about everything and one of my weaknesses is that I have no experience with R or any programming language at that. Seeing as there was no required classes to learn how to computationally collect, organize, and interpret data, I decided to take matters into my own hands and register for this introductory class. I am taking BIS15L in hopes of broadening my knowledge when it comes to coding languages and am looking forward to learning and growing in a collaborative environment 🧠💡!

# 🧬 My First Repository 🧬
This is my first repository ever. Before today I didn't even know what a repository was. As I embark on this journey of BIS15L I am going to make a "what I learned" section in my README to make it my own and so I can keep record of how far I've come at the end of the quarter. It'll probably be found below eventually. Ten weeks doesn't seem very long but at the end of the quarter I'm always shocked by how much information I've learned in such a short span of time.
