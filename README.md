My name is Jenna Hussein, I'm a fourth year undergraduate student majoring in Genetics and Genomics. I am taking BIS15L in hopes of broadening my knowledge when it comes to coding languages. I have no previous experience with R and am looking forward to learning in a collaborative environment. The best way to reach me is by email at jenhussein@ucdavis.edu
